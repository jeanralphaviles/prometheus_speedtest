## Getting Started

These instructions will install and run `prometheus_speedtest` on your system.

### PyPi Package

`prometheus_speedtest` is provided as a
[PyPi package](https://pypi.org/project/prometheus_speedtest).

1. Installing

   ```shell
   pip install prometheus_speedtest
   ```

1. Running

   ```shell
   prometheus_speedtest
   ```

#### Usage

```
Instrument speedtest.net speedtests from Prometheus.
flags:

prometheus_speedtest.py:
  --address: address to listen on
    (default: '0.0.0.0')
  --excludes: speedtest server(s) to exclude - leave empty for no exclusion
    (a comma separated list)
  --port: port to listen on
    (default: '9516')
    (an integer)
  --servers: speedtest server(s) to use - leave empty for auto-selection
    (a comma separated list)
  --[no]version: show version
    (default: 'false')
```

### Running with Docker

`prometheus_speedtest` is also available as a [Docker](http://docker.com) image
on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/jraviles/prometheus_speedtest)
:whale:.

```shell
docker run --rm -d --name prometheus_speedtest -p 9516:9516/tcp jraviles/prometheus_speedtest:latest
```

You can also append extra flags when running with Docker. For example:

```shell
$ docker run --rm --name prometheus_speedtest -p 9516:9516/tcp \
    jraviles/prometheus_speedtest:latest --version
prometheus_speedtest v0.9.9
```

### Running with Kubernetes

Since you can run this from a Docker container, you can also run it in Kubernetes.

```shell
kubectl apply -f deploy/namespace.yaml
kubectl apply -f deploy/deployment.yaml
```

The Kubernetes YAML files are pre-configured to work with the
`kubernetes-pods-slow` job that comes with Prometheus, which is configured with
5m scrape times and 30s timeouts.  If you need to raise the timeout, you'll
need to change that in your Prometheus config map.

Just keep in mind, that if you increase the replica count, then Prometheus will
run a speedtest for each pod, every 5m. The same goes for if you are running
more than one replica of Prometheus, as each replica independently scrapes
targets.

### Integrating with Prometheus

`prometheus_speedtest` is best when paired with
[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io). Prometheus can be configured to perform
Speedtests on an interval and record their results.

Speedtest metrics available to query in Prometheus.

| Metric Name           | Description                 |
|---------------------- |---------------------------- |
| download\_speed\_bps  | Download speed (bit/s)      |
| upload\_speed\_bps    | Upload speed (bit/s)        |
| ping\_ms              | Latency (ms)                |
| bytes\_received       | Bytes received during test  |
| bytes\_sent           | Bytes sent during test      |

#### prometheus.yml config

Add this to your
[Prometheus config](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration)
to start instrumenting Speedtests and recording their metrics.

```yaml
global:
  scrape_timeout: 2m

scrape_configs:
- job_name: 'speedtest'
  metrics_path: /probe
  static_configs:
  - targets:
    - localhost:9516
```

Note if you're running `prometheus` under Docker, you must link the
`prometheus` container to `prometheus_speedtest`. See the steps below for how
this can be done.

#### Trying it out

An example
[Prometheus config](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration)
has been provided at
[example/prometheus.yml](https://github.com/jeanralphaviles/prometheus_speedtest/blob/master/example/prometheus.yml).
We'll start `prometheus` with this config.

1. Docker Network

   Create the [Docker network](https://docs.docker.com/network) that will link
   `prometheus_speedtest` and `prometheus` together.

   ```shell
   docker network create prometheus_network
   ```

1. Start Prometheus Speedtest

   ```shell
   docker run --rm -d --net prometheus_network -p 9516:9516/tcp \
      --name prometheus_speedtest jraviles/prometheus_speedtest:latest
   ```

1. Start Prometheus

   ```shell
   docker run --rm -d --net prometheus_network -p 9516:9516/tcp \
      -v $PWD/example/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
      --name prometheus prom/prometheus:latest
   ```

1. Query results

   * Visit <http://localhost:9516/probe>

   * Wait around **45 seconds** for Prometheus to perform a Speedtest

   * Issue a query for **download\_speed\_bps**

     You should see something like this.

### Instrumenting Speedtests with cURL

Once `prometheus_speedtest` has been started, with either Docker or PyPi,
Speedtests can be instrumented with [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se).

```shell
$ curl localhost:9516/probe
# HELP download_speed_bps Download speed (bit/s)
# TYPE download_speed_bps gauge
download_speed_bps 88016694.95692767
# HELP upload_speed_bps Upload speed (bit/s)
# TYPE upload_speed_bps gauge
upload_speed_bps 3415613.277989314
# HELP ping_ms Latency (ms)
# TYPE ping_ms gauge
ping_ms 20.928
# HELP bytes_received Bytes received during test
# TYPE bytes_received gauge
bytes_received 111342756.0
# HELP bytes_sent Bytes sent during test
# TYPE bytes_sent gauge
bytes_sent 5242880.0
```

You can also visit <http://localhost:9516/probe> in your browser to see the same
metrics.

### Default Port

Prometheus Speedtest defaults to running on port 9516; this is the allocated
port for this exporter in the
[Prometheus Default Port Allocations Guide](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/wiki/Default-port-allocations).
